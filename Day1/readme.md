# Day 1 of the Advent of hashtag#OperationsResearch ðŸ¤ 

I'm struggling to organize a series of events...

Each event requires a dedicated room.

Some events have overlapping participants, so I can't schedule them in the same room at the same time.

How many rooms do I need? How can I assign each event to a room so that no two overlapping events are scheduled in the same one?

Ideally, I want to minimize the total number of rooms used.
